#  Sales Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest Ensemble Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the sales of 1559 products across 10 stores located in different cities. The dataset includes various attributes for each product and store. The goal is to apply linear regression and random forest ensemble learning techniques to predict the sales of each product at a specific store.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores. It includes attributes for each product and store, such as product ID, store ID, city, product features, and historical sales data.
# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the dataset for training and testing.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify any patterns or trends.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features and transform them as needed for model training.
Model Training: Implement linear regression and random forest ensemble learning algorithms to train the predictive models using the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare their performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to optimize their performance.
Predicting Sales: Apply the trained models to predict the sales of each product at a particular store.
Results and Discussion: Summarize the findings, discuss the performance of the models, and provide insights into the sales predictions.
